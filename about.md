Hi, I'm Mike and I live in Seoul, Korea. Thanks for visiting my site.

I build iOS / Mac apps, dabble in other cool programming languages and write about software development when I have the time.

I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work. You can reach me at the blue links shown below.

I am also actively looking for an internship. Email me and I will be happy to
send you my resume.
