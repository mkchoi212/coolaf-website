I don't know about you or what other cool cats are doing nowadays, but I use RSS (Really Simple Syndication) to suck in all the content from the Internet. To get specific, I use [Reeder](http://reederapp.com/mac/) as my primary RSS application and [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com) as my goto save-for-later bucket.

During the summer of 2016, I became obsessed with HackerNews. In the beginning, it was nice because I was reading and absorbing anything and everything interesting that was going on the Internet. I was learning something new everyday and was becoming a better developer. In addition, I was up-to-date with the latest gossips and practically heard of every "new cool language/framework/testing tool". However, this came with a price. I was checking HackerNews about 10-15 times a day. No article went by me unread. Every single article had that faint light gray color as they went past my fingers of fury. At a certain point, it seemed like I was reading more than I was coding.

Then school started again.

What used to be a morning ritual of checking HackerNews became impossible. If I was lucky, I got to check the feed once or twice a day. Even then, I would only be able to read one or two articles and save the rest into Instapaper. And eventually, Instapaper became a place where essays and blog posts go to die and rot in a pile of their own digital waste.

RSS was even worse. I had subscribed to about 30+ RSS sources and was getting up to 60 new articles per day. After about a week into school, I didn't even try to catch up on these. In fact, Reeder ended up losing its spot on my Dock.

It's Winter Break now and it's about 55 degrees in Texas. I'm currently sitting at a cafe drinking a latte that is way too sweet and trying to fix the mess I have found myself in. To do this, I wrote myself a little prescription. If you are experiencing the same symptoms as I am, I recommend you do the same.

## Rules of Engagement with articles from the Interweb/HackerNews

### **1. Read at least 5 articles from my saved Instapaper feed every day**

*DO NOT ADD NEW ARTICLES UNTIL THE RED BUBBLE THINGY REACHES ZERO!*

### **2. Limit reading HackerNews to only TWICE a day**

### **3. Only keep 4-5 most interesting subscriptions in Reeder's RSS feed**
I know there are lots of interesting articles out there but you will never get to all of them.
