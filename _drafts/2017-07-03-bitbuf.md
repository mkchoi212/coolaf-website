**TL;DR Don't use Python if you need to do bit processing**

Hey, you should click that 🌟 button.

# 🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️🤦‍♂️ (dis-satisfied emoji man)
In my last work, I played around with bits a lot. When I say bits, I mean binary data files that were sometimes as small as 10 Mb but sometimes as big as 2 Gb.

But I wasn't just playing around with them. I can not tell you in detail but I basically had to apply particular transformations and get a satisfying end result; that couldn't have been any more vague ha.

Anyways, the most common fiddling operations I did consisted of reversing bits and finding sub-patterns within the binary file. But the things I needed to do varied time to time; sometimes I needed to find sub-patterns and sometimes I needed to take a single bit and skip 7 more bits afterwards. 

So naturally, I looked for a scripting language that could process the bits easily and took little time to program as the opeartions I applied to the bits changed frequently.

## Language candidates
I first thought of *Python* and *Ruby* as the language of choice.. You may think, "Script languages would be teribble at these things because of their speed!" Well, speed didn't really matter until the end when I found a solution and needed to automate the processing process. Until then, I only needed to process a single file at a time to check my work.

Anyways, Ruby on the system server at the time was really old so I decided to go with Python; great way to make decisions.

## Library candidates
I started Googling and came across [bitstring](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/bitstring/3.1.3). The website described it as
> Allows simple construction, analysis and modification of binary data.

That is just what I am looking for. I did some testing to see how fast this thing is.

I decided to pick `reverse` as the function to benchmark.
Here's the result of reversing every 4 bits of a 1 Gb binary array.

But ok... That took less than a minute to code and considering the fact that I will be only processing one file at a time, that's not so bad.

Time to automate things. After 10 more minutes of coding and waiting for 2 hours for the result (using 4 CPU's via Pythons `multiprocessing.Pool`), I knew this wasn't going to cut it.

> I NEEDED SOMETHING FASTER! 🔥

Obviously, I needed to change the language I was using. Python and bitstring couldn't keep up anymore.

# 💭 The Idea
You probably have heard of Linus Torvalds, the guy who said

> Software is like sex: it's better when it's free.

He made Git and in [git's git repo](https://github.com/git/git), you can find [strbuf.h/c](https://github.com/git/git/blob/e629a7d28a405e48fae6b064a781a10e885159fc/strbuf.h). `strbuf` is something I'm guessing Torvalds made while he was making Git because he was tired of handling strings in C in the usual way. He's really good at describing what it does so go check it out.

After looking at this, I decided to write something like `strbuf` but for bits... and call it bitbuf.


# Implementation
I tried to follow Torvalds in the smallest details possible but obviously had to change, add, and remove couple of things to make bitbuf. For example, 

```c
struct strbuf {
	size_t alloc;
	size_t len;
	char *buf;
};
```

became 

```c
struct bitbuf {
	size_t alloc;
	size_t len;
	unsigned char *buf;
};
```

and 

```c
static inline void strbuf_addch(struct strbuf *sb, int c)
```

became

```c
extern void bitbuf_addbyte( struct bitbuf *bb, unsigned char b );
``` 

To support bit manipulations, I had to add functions like 

```c
void bitbuf_reverse( bitbuf * ,size_t start, size_t n );
void bitbuf_and( const bitbuf *, const bitbuf *, bitbuf *res );
```
