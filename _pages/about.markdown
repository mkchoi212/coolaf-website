Hi, I'm Mike and I live in Seoul, Korea. Thanks for visiting my site.

I build iOS / Mac apps, dabble in other cool programming languages and write
about software development when I have the time.

I am also actively looking for an internship. [Email](mailto:mkchoi212@icloud.com) me and I will be happy to
send you my resume.

<h2>About the site</h2>
The site's title `0xdeadbeef` is a [hexspeak](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hexspeak) I used a lot while I was building [bitbuf](https://github.com/mkchoi212/bitbuf).

This site was made on an [Apple MBP](https://www.apple.com/) powered by [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com) on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
I'd love to hear your feedback on this site and my work.
