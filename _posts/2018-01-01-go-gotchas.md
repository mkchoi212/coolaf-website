First thing is first. Happy New Years üéâüéâ

Now that's out of the way, let's talk about Go. I recently finished making my first real Go program. It's called "Fix All Conflicts" or [fac](https://github.com/mkchoi212/fac) for short. It's an easy-to-use console user interface for fixing git merge conflicts. I made it because I never found a merge tool that was intuitive enough to use. 


The process was quite fun and I learned a lot about Go in the process. So, to wrap up my first official foray into Rob Pike's mystical land of gophers, I decided to write down some of the common "Gotchas!" that any beginning Gopher - me - can run into.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è #1. Range

The `range` function is one of the most commonly used functions in Go. Here's a sample use case of the `range` function. Note that for some demented reason, we decided to make all the animals in the zoo have `999` legs.
```go
package main

import "fmt"

type Animal struct {
	name string
	legs int
}

func main() {
	zoo := []Animal{
		Animal{"Dog", 4},
		Animal{"Chicken", 2},
		Animal{"Snail", 0},
	}

	fmt.Printf("-> Before update %v\n", zoo)

	for _, animal := range zoo {
		// üö® Oppps! `animal` is a copy of an element üòß
		animal.legs = 999
	}

	fmt.Printf("\n-> After update %v\n", zoo)
}
```
The above code looks innocent enough. However, you may be surprised to find that `animals.legs = 999` didn't do anything.

```
-> Before update [{Dog 4} {Chicken 2} {Snail 0}]
-> After update  [{Dog 4} {Chicken 2} {Snail 0}] üö®üö®üö® 
```

#### Lesson

> Value property of `range` (stored here as `animal`) is a **copy of the value from `zoo`, not a pointer to the value in `zoo`.**

#### üõ†Ô∏è The Fix

In order to modify an element within the array, we must change the element via its **pointer**.

```go
for idx := range zoo {
  zoo[idx].legs = 999
}
```
This may look quite trivial but you may be surprised to find this as a one of the most common source of bugs; at least for me!

# ‚ö†Ô∏è #2. The ‚Ä¶ thingy

You may have used the `‚Ä¶` keyword in the C programming language to create a [variadic function](https://www.gnu.org/software/libc/manual/html_node/Variadic-Functions.html); variadic function is a function that takes a variable number or type of arguments.

In C, you have to successively call the `va_arg` macro in order to access the optional arguments. And if you use the variadic argument in any other way, the compiler will throw an error.

```c
int add_em_up (int count,...) {
  ...
  va_start (ap, count);         /* Initialize the argument list */
  for (i = 0; i < count; i++)
      sum += va_arg(ap, int);   /* Get the next argument value */
  va_end (ap);                  /* Clean up */
  return sum
}
```

In Go however, things are similar but quite different at the same time. Here is a variadic function `myFprint` in Go. Notice how the variadic argument `a` is being used.

```go
func myFprint(format string, a ...interface{}) {
	if len(a) == 0 {
		fmt.Printf(format)
	} else {
		// ‚ö†Ô∏è `a` should be `a...`
		fmt.Printf(format, a)
		// ‚úÖ
		fmt.Printf(format, a...)
	}
}

func main() {
	myFprint("%s : line %d\n", "file.txt", 49)
}
```

```
[file.txt %!s(int=49)] : line %!d(MISSING)
file.txt : line 49
```

You'd think that the compiler would throw an error here for using the variadic parameter `a` in a wrong way. But notice how `fmt.Sprintf` just used the first argument in `a ` without throwing a fit.

#### Lesson

> In Go, **variadic parameters are converted to slices by the compiler**

This means that the variadic argument `a` is in fact, just a slice. Because of this, the code below is completely valid.

```go
// `a` is just a slice!
for _, elem := range a {
  fmt.Println(elem)
}
```

#### üõ†Ô∏è The Fix

> **Remember to type ALL THREE DOTS whenever using variadic parameters!**

# ‚ö†Ô∏è #3. Slicing
If you have done your fair share of slicing in Python, you may remember that slicing in Python gives you a new list with just the references to the elements copied over. This property allows for code like this in Python.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]
b = a[:2]			# üëÄ a completely new list!
b[0] = 999
>>> a
[1, 2, 3]
>>> b
[999, 2]
```

However if you try the same thing in Go, you get something else.

```go
func main() {
	data := []int{1, 2, 3}
	slice := data[:2]
	slice[0] = 999

	fmt.Println(data)
	fmt.Println(slice)
}
```

```
[999 2 3]
[999 2]
```

#### Lesson

> In Go, **a slice shares the same backing array and capacity as the original.** So if you change an element in the slice, the original contents are modified as well.

#### üõ†Ô∏è The Fix

If you want to get an independent slice, you have two options.

```go
// Option #1
// appending elements to a nil slice
// `...` changes slice to arguments for the variadic function `append`
a := append([]int{}, data[:2]...)

// Option #1
// Create slice with length of 2
// copy(dest, src)
a := make([]int, 2)
copy(a, data[:2])
```

And according to [StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/a/44337887/4064189), the `append` option is slightly faster than the `make. + copy` option!
