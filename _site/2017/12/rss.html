        <p>I don’t know about you or what other cool cats are doing nowadays, but I use RSS (Really Simple Syndication) to suck in all the content from the Internet. To get specific, I use <a href="http://reederapp.com/mac/">Reeder</a> as my primary RSS application and <a href="https://www.instapaper.com">Instapaper</a> as my goto save-for-later bucket.</p>

<p>During the summer of 2016, I became obsessed with HackerNews. In the beginning, it was nice because I was reading and absorbing anything and everything interesting that was going on the Internet. I was learning something new everyday and was becoming a better developer. In addition, I was up-to-date with the latest gossips and practically heard of every “new cool language/framework/testing tool”. However, this came with a price. I was checking HackerNews about 10-15 times a day. No article went by me unread. Every single article had that faint light gray color as they went past my fingers of fury. At a certain point, it seemed like I was reading more than I was coding.</p>

<p>Then school started again.</p>

<p>What used to be a morning ritual of checking HackerNews became impossible. If I was lucky, I got to check the feed once or twice a day. Even then, I would only be able to read one or two articles and save the rest into Instapaper. And eventually, Instapaper became a place where essays and blog posts go to die and rot in a pile of their own digital waste.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="https://www.deadbeef.me/assets/blogging/insta.jpeg" alt="My Insta" /></p>

<p>RSS was even worse. I had subscribed to about 30+ RSS sources and was getting up to 60 new articles per day. After about a week into school, I didn’t even try to catch up on these. In fact, Reeder ended up losing its spot on my Dock.</p>

<p class="center"><img src="https://www.deadbeef.me/assets/blogging/rss.png" alt="Oh god.." /></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I bet 5000 unread articles is some sort of new record. I also bet 5000 is the highest number of unread articles Feedly will let you have.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It’s Winter Break now and it’s about 55 degrees in Texas. I’m currently sitting at a cafe drinking a latte that is way too sweet and trying to fix the mess I have found myself in. To do this, I wrote myself a little prescription. If you are experiencing the same symptoms as I am, I recommend you do the same.</p>

<h3 id="1-read-at-least-5-articles-from-my-saved-instapaper-feed-every-day"><strong>1. Read at least 5 articles from my saved Instapaper feed every day</strong></h3>

<p><em>DO NOT ADD NEW ARTICLES UNTIL THE RED BUBBLE THINGY REACHES ZERO!</em></p>

<p>I know there are lots of interesting articles out there but you will never get to all of them.</p>
