**Website is not complete. Things may not look..right yet**

Hi, I'm Mike and I live in Seoul, Korea. Thanks for visiting my site.

I build iOS / Mac apps, dabble in other cool programming languages and write about software development when I have the time.

I am also actively looking for an internship. Email me and I will be happy to send you my resume.

Lastly, note that I am not a web designer. I got this beautiful theme from [here](https://github.com/fffabs/estivo).
