Today, we are going to talk about something that is boring... but necessary; tests.

But you are probably tired of reading blog posts that talk about *"Why testing is important", "Why your thing should have tests", and "Top 5 reasons you should adopt test-driven development"*. So, instead of writing about the usual "You need tests because it will blah your blah with blah because of blah", I want to talk about something else; **how to make writing tests not suck as much.**

Here are some tips and tricks I picked up while writing tests for [fac](https://github.com/mkchoi212/fac). 

## 1. Current Testing Directory

Here is a fun fact; when you run `go test` for a package, the test binary will be run within the package being tested. 

Allow me to demonstrate. Assume your project directory is setup like this

```
project
â””â”€â”€ server
    â”œâ”€â”€ server.go
    â””â”€â”€ server_test.go
```

And your `server_test.go` looks like this

```go
package server

import (
	"os"
	"testing"
)

func TestCoolServerStuff(t *testing.T) {
	wd, _ := os.Getwd()
	t.Log(wd)
}
```

If you run this from your root `project` directory, you will get the following output

```bash
âžœ pwd
/Users/mikechoi/src/go/src/github.com/mkchoi212/project

âžœ go test -v
=== RUN   TestCoolServerStuff
--- PASS: TestCoolServerStuff (0.00s)
          server_test.go:10: github.com/mkchoi212/project/server
PASS
ok        github.com/mkchoi212/project/server        0.007s
```

Notice that the log says `github.com/mkchoi212/project/server` and not whatever `pwd` said.

## 2. testdata is ignored

According to [this Go documentation](https://golang.org/cmd/go/#hdr-Package_lists), 

> Directory and file names that begin with "." or "_" are ignored by the go tool, as are directories named "testdata".

So, if you need mock files to test something - such as `response.json` for your networking functions - you can place it in `package_directory/testdata/response.json`. Now, you can easily load the mock files like so

```go
func TestServerResponse(t *testing.T) {
    if json, err := os.Open("testdata/response.json"); err != nil {
        doStuffWithNetworkResponse(json)
        t.Log("ðŸŽ‰")
    }
}
```

Notice that we are able to simple say `testdata/response.json` because of #1.

## 3. testhelper

This is a simple concept but is very helpful when writing tests in Go. When writing code in Go, you probably have written thousands of lines of code that look like this

```go
if data, err := doSomethingCool(); err != nil {
    doMoreCoolThingsHere(data)
}
```

The trouble is that this is what 80% of statements you are going to tests are going to look like. After all, you are testing if something either didn't return an error, is equal to something, and or didn't crap out. Eventually, your testsuite will get filled with `if data, err := ....; err != nil` statements. So, the brilliant solution to this is **to make helper functions**.

<script src="https://gist.github.com/mkchoi212/730f09c9a2676803d34138da6d923db0.js"></script>

Instead of writing the code you saw previously with bunch of if-statements, you can now write the following.

```go
func TestCoolThing(t *testing.T) {
    data, err := doSomethingCool()
    // Awesome
    testhelper.Ok(t, err)
    
    otherData, err := doSomethingAmazing()
    testhelper.Ok(t, err)

    // This is really useful as well
    testhelper.Equals(t, data, otherData)	
}
```

And if a test fails for some reason, the helper functions will print out the error messages in red and pin-point the location where the test failed.

## 3. go test tricks

Here are some additional tips and tricks you can use while using `go test`.

#### Test all packages in project directory

`./...` is the magic argument.

```bash
âžœ go test
ok      github.com/mkchoi212/project              [no test files]

âžœ go test ./...
ok      github.com/mkchoi212/project              [no test files]
ok      github.com/mkchoi212/project/server       0.012s
ok      github.com/mkchoi212/project/testhelper   [no test files]
```

#### Ignore package while testing

You might need this when you don't necessarily need to test something or because you just want a higher code coverage percentage ðŸ˜„

> Notice `testhelper` is not being tested any more

```bash
âžœ go test `go list ./... | grep -v 'testhelper'`
ok      github.com/mkchoi212/project              [no test files]
ok      github.com/mkchoi212/project/server       0.012s
```

#### Code coverage statistics

```bash
âžœ go test --cover
PASS
coverage: 100.0% of statements
ok      github.com/mkchoi212/project/server  0.011s
```
